			<center><h1>DELHI - With Historic and Great Past</h1>
			<img src="../drawables/delhi.jpeg" height="400px" width="500px"></center><br><br>
			<p>Delhi, the bustling capital of India makes for one of the perfect travel destinations in India. A city of heritage monuments, teeming bazaars and mouth-watering street food reminding you of its rich past from the Mughal era to a city that is today, more cosmopolitan and contemporary with its sprawling boulevards, high-end malls, shopping complexes and luxury hotels & restaurants; Delhi is for sure, a true amalgamation of age old cultures and present day’s modernization. Be it a stroll through the narrow lanes of ‘Chandni Chowk’ relishing on its lip-smacking chaats, a real shopping fun in the streets of ‘Sarojini Nagar’ or more exotic ‘Delhi Haat’, a heritage walk through the awe-inspiring Mughal architectural masterpieces of ‘Humayun’s Tomb’ and ‘Qutub Minar’, a visit to the 700 years old ‘Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah’, a lovely experience of relishing on some tasty cuisine sitting at a lake side café in the posh ‘Hauz Khas Village’, a memorable time at the lively ‘Kingdom of Dreams’ enjoying a musical Bollywood night, or a picnic time at the iconic ‘India Gate’; the list of ‘must-do things’ in Delhi has no end.</p>
