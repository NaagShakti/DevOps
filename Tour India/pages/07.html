			<p>An enormous stretch of white salt that is submerged under water for 4 months in a year, the great Rann of Kutch in Gujarat is an incredible place to visit in India. With its astounding natural beauty, the world’s one of the greatest salt desert is swarmed by an endless number of tourists every year, especially during the famous ‘Rann Utsav’ when the white canvas gets painted into different hues and shades. Live folk music and dance performances, camel safaris, a rustic stay and a delicious Kutch cuisine makes this experience an unforgettable one for every visitor. From walking along vast stretches of white getting a glimpse of salt making process, watching colourful migratory birds in the Chhari Dhand Bird Sanctuary, getting breath-taking views of the infinite expanse of the Rann from ‘Kala Dungar’ to seeing the artisans creating magic with their hands making exquisite embroidery pieces; a trip to Rann of Kutch is truly an eye-opener. What adds to the charm of this memorable trip is a stay in traditional ‘Bhungas’ or cylindrical shaped huts with conical roofs in the enchanting ‘Hodka Village’ nearby. Providing you a feel of a rustic village life, these huts are beautifully decorated with traditional mirror work patterns and delicate lattice work.
