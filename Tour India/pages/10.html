			<p>One of the most breathtakingly beautiful places in India, Sikkim is a glittering gem of the North-East Himalayas. With its enchanting snow-capped mountains, quaint little villages, pristine lakes and vibrant Buddhist monasteries, Sikkim is one of the best destinations in India to spend a peaceful and laid back holiday amidst extreme tranquillity and solitude. Teeming with some of the world’s best scenic trekking trails and rivers ideal for indulging in real thrill of white water rafting, this little North-Eastern state also makes for a perfect adventure destination in India for trekkers, rafters, mountaineers and rock climbers. Be it the breath-taking panoramas of the rhododendron carpets as you trek to the enchanting ‘Yumthang Valley’, the surreal experience of reaching the ‘Gurudongmar’ and ‘Cholamu’ lakes or an ecstasy of braving the strong currents of River Teesta as you navigate through twist and turns of the torrential river during the white water rafting adventure; Sikkim never ceases to hypnotise you with its serene magic of nature</p>
