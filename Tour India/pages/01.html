			<p>One of the most incredible places in India, Kashmir is known for its enthralling beauty and is rightly nicknamed as the ‘Heaven on Earth’. With its Picturesque lakes, striking fruit orchards, verdant meadows surrounded with thick woods of pines and deodars, lush green gardens teeming with vibrant flowers and captivating valleys enclosed with snow-covered peaks of Himalayan and Pir-Panjal ranges – Kashmir seems to have directly made its way out from a picture postcard. From enjoying a heavenly ‘Shikara boat ride‘ on the pristine ‘Dal Lake’, strolling through the beautifully manicured ‘Mughal Gardens’, soaking in the untouched pastoral beauty of ‘Betaab’ and ‘Aru’ valleys, paying your homage to ‘Amarnath ji’ standing amidst the ethereal natural beauty of the tiny hamlet of ‘Chandanwari’, relishing the moment of plucking a fresh walnut at one the ‘Walnut Orchards’, braving the strong currents of River Sind during white water rafting in ‘Sonmarg’ to revelling in the adventure of world’s highest Gondola ride at Gulmarg – the magic of Kashmir with its breath-taking vistas is sure to captivate your heart and soul forever. Make sure to buy some of the traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and handlooms items and do try out few of the state’s world famous ‘Wazwan’ delicacies before returning from a memorable holiday in Kashmir.</p>
